## Land Calculator (WEB APP)

The Land Calculator web app is designed to assist users in quickly and accurately calculating the area of a piece of land based on various units of measurement commonly used in real estate and land management. This tool is particularly useful for individuals involved in property assessment, land surveying, real estate development, or anyone who needs to estimate land area for planning or legal purposes.

With the Land Calculator, users can input the dimensions of the land, including length and width, and select their preferred unit of measurement such as sarsai, feet, or other standard units. The app then computes the area of the land in acres, kanals, marlas, sarsai, and feet, providing a comprehensive breakdown for easy reference.
